# Introduction to Containers, Docker and the IBM Container Registry

## Outcomes

You will understand the following concepts:
- item1
- item2

## Prerequisites

TBD

# Step 1: Ensure environment is installed
1. Open the terminal in the provided environment by using the menu in the editor `Terminal -> New Terminal`.
   
   ![terminal](images/terminal.png)

2. Make sure the environment has been configured by running the following commands in the terminal.
   - Check docker is installed
        ```
        theia@theiadocker-ulidder:/home/project$ docker --version
        >> Docker version 18.09.7, build 2d0083d
        ```
   - Check ibmcloud CLI is installed
        ```
        theia@theiadocker-ulidder:/home/project$ ibmcloud --version
        >> ibmcloud version 1.0.0+908f90a-2020-03-30T06:37:22+00:00
        ```

# Step 2: Let's pull our first docker image from Docker Hub

1. Use the docker command to see what images you currently have in this environment. You should see an empty table as shown below
   ```
   theia@theiadocker-ulidder:/home/project$ docker images
    
   >> REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
   ```
2. Let's download our first image from Docker Hub
   ```
   theia@theiadocker-ulidder:/home/project$ docker pull hello-world
   
    >> Using default tag: latest
    latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
    0e03bdcc26d7: Pull complete 
    Digest: sha256:6a65f928fb91fcfbc963f7aa6d57c8eeb426ad9a20c7ee045538ef34847f44f1
    Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
   ```
3. If you do a `docker images` again, you should now see this image in the local environment.
   ```
    theia@theiadocker-ulidder:/home/project$ docker images

    >> REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
       hello-world         latest              bf756fb1ae65        4 months ago        13.3kB
   ```
4. In order to build a container from this image, we can simply run it.
   ```
   theia@theiadocker-ulidder:/home/project$ docker run hello-world
   
   >> Hello from Docker!
   ```
5. You just built an image and ran a container based on this image! You can see the list of containers by using the `docker ps` command. 
   ```
    theia@theiadocker-ulidder:/home/project$ docker ps -a
    >> CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES
       08041e5d9e52        hello-world         "/hello"            3 minutes ago       Exited (0) 3 minutes ago                       sweet_gates
   ```
6. Let's remove the container now that we are done with it.
   ```
    theia@theiadocker-ulidder:/home/project$ docker container rm 08041e5d9e52
    >> 08041e5d9e52

    theia@theiadocker-ulidder:/home/project$ docker ps -a
    >> CONTAINER ID        IMAGE
   ```

When done on downloading and running you first container! Let's build one on our own instead of using something from Docker Hub.

# Step 3: Build your own image using a Dockerfile

1. This directory contains a simple Node.js application that we will install in a container. 
    - app.js is the main application. It simply replies with a hello world message.
    - package.json defines the dependencies of the application.
    - DockerFile is how we tell Docker to build our container.
  
2. In order to build the container, simply type the following command
    ```
    docker build . -t containers_course:myimage

    Successfully built 0846c929b52f
    Successfully tagged containers_course:myimage
    ```
3. If we now do a `docker ps`, we will see our container tagged `containers_course:myimage` in the table.
    ```
    docker images


    REPOSITORY                            TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
    containers_course                     myimage             0846c929b52f        7 minutes ago       76.1MB
    ```

# Step 4: Run the image
1. Now that we have build our own image, let's run the container.
    ```
    docker run -p 8080:8080 containers_course:myimage

    Sample app is listening on port 8080.
    ```

2. Split the terminal by using `Terminal -> Split Terminal` menu.
    
    ![Split the terminal](images/terminal-split.png)

1. You can now use the curl command to ping the application

    ```
    curl localhost:8080

    Hello world from 285d092bb4d0! Your app is up and running in a cluster!
    ```
2. The final step is to stop the container. We can use `docker stop` command. It requires a container id as the second option. We are using `docker ps -q` to pass in the list of all running containers.
    ```
    docker stop $(docker ps -q)
    ```

# Step 5: Publish the image to IBM Cloud Registry
1. Log in to the IBM Cloud CLI: 

   ```
   ibmcloud login
   ```

    **Note:** If you have a federated ID, use `ibmcloud login --sso` to log in to the IBM Cloud CLI. You know you have a federated ID when the login fails without the `--sso` and succeeds with the `--sso` option.

2. In order to upload images to the IBM Cloud Container Registry, you first need to create a namespace with the following command: 

   ```
   ibmcloud cr namespace-add <my_namespace>
   ```

3. Build the container image with a `1` tag and push the image to the IBM Cloud Registry:

   ```
   ibmcloud cr build --tag us.icr.io/<my_namespace>/hello-world:1 .
   ```

4. Verify the image is built: 

   ```
   ibmcloud cr images
   ```

This concludes the guided exercise.
