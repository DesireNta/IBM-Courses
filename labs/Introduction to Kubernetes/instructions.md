# Introduction to Kubernetes

## Outcomes

You learned the basics of Docker including images and containers in the last lab. You also pushed an image to IBM Cloud Registry. In this lab, you will
- work with `kubectl` CLI
- create your first pod
- create your first deployment

## Prerequisites

The complete environment to finish this lab is provided for you at this link <tbd>. 

# Step 1: Ensure environment is installed
1. Open the terminal in the provided environment by using the menu in the editor `Terminal -> New Terminal`.
   
   ![terminal](images/terminal.png)

2. Make sure the environment has been configured by running the following commands in the terminal.
   - Check docker is installed
        ```
        theia@theiadocker-ulidder:/home/project$ docker --version
        >> Docker version 18.09.7, build 2d0083d
        ```
   - Check ibmcloud CLI is installed
        ```
        theia@theiadocker-ulidder:/home/project$ ibmcloud --version
        >> ibmcloud version 1.0.0+908f90a-2020-03-30T06:37:22+00:00

2. Make sure kubectl is installed by running the following commands in the terminal. You should get an output that looks something like this. The versions might be different.
   ```
   $ kubectl version
   
      Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"17", GitVersion:"v1.17.2", GitCommit:"59603c6e503c87169aea6106f57b9f242f64df89", G
      itTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2020-01-18T23:30:10Z", GoVersion:"go1.13.5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
      Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"16", GitVersion:"v1.16.10+IKS", GitCommit:"a0052bd119c067cf48e8a19f0ab7d5a5e2ca0a1
      8", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2020-05-20T20:48:06Z", GoVersion:"go1.13.9", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
   ```


what was done in lab 1
- learned about docker (images and containers)
- pushed an image to ibmcloud cr
What do I want to show here?
- you get a free cluster with this lab
  - show some commands
  - cluster info
  - list all pods
  - list all deployments
- create a simple deployment
  - run a pod first with dockerhub ngnix file
  - run is an imperative command
  - show commands to delete, etc
  - explain describe command to get yaml and json
- deploy previous application from ibmcloud cr to the cluster


# Step 2: Work with kubectl CLI
The kubectl CLI is already installed for you in this environment. Not only that, the environment created a free cluster for your use with one worker node. Let's look at some basic kubectl commands.

1. Get cluster information using the `kubectl cluster-info` command
   ```
   $ kubectl config get-clusters
   
      NAME
      labs-user-sandbox-prod-tor01/bp1hokjw0e5bk715r7f0
   ```
2. You also learned about pods in this module. Let's list all the pods currnetly in our cluster. If this is a new session for you, you will not see any pods.
      ```
      $ kubectl get pods
      
         No resources found in sn-labs-upkaribmwats namespace.
      ```

# Step 3: Create a pod
1. Let's create our first pod. We will use the `nginx` image on Docker Hub to create this pod. As explained in the video for this module, you can create a pod imperatively or declaratively. Let's look at the imperative way first where we tell the cluster what to do using the `kubectl run` command.
   ```
      $ kubectl run nginx --image nginx

         kubectl run --generator=deployment/apps.v1 is DEPRECATED and will be removed in a future version. Use kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1 or kubectl create instead.

         deployment.apps/nginx created
   ```
   You will see a warning, but the pod has been created for you. 
2. Let's see the actual pod using the `kubectl get <resource>` command. This command prints out the details of the cluster resource in a table format. There are many paratmers you can use with this command. Let's look at some simple use cases.
   ```
   $ kubectl get pods
      NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
      nginx-6db489d4b7-2nzd8   1/1     Running   0          2m55s
   ```
   Great, the previous command indeed created a pod for us. It is called `nginx-6db489d4b7-2nzd8`. Your pod will most likely have a different name.  
3. Let's delete this pod by using the `kubectl delete <resource> <name>` command.
   ```
   $ kubectl delete pod nginx-6db489d4b7-2nzd8
   
      pod "nginx-6db489d4b7-2nzd8" deleted
   ```
4. Let's get all the pods another time to see if it was actually deleted.
   ```
      $ kubectl get pods

         NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
         nginx-6db489d4b7-rstbf   1/1     Running   0          77s
   ```
   Wait a second! We deleted the pod in the previous step, so why is it still there? The reason is that the `kubectl run` command actually created a `deployment` for us with a `replica` of 1. Therefore, the cluster automatically created another pod for us when we deleted the original one. You will see the pod name is different as well. 
5. We can use the `kubectl describe <resource> <name> command to see the details for this pod.
   ```
   $ kubectl describe pod nginx-6db489d4b7-rstbf

   Name:         nginx-6db489d4b7-rstbf
   Namespace:    sn-labs-upkaribmwats

      Mounts:
         /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount from default-token-n6v4s (ro)
   ...
   ...
   ```
   As you can see, the pod has a replicaset associated wit it.
6. In order to delete all the resources we have created so far, we need to delete the deployment itself using the `kubectl delete <resource> <name>` command.
   ```
   
   ```
7. 


When done, close the browser tab.

This concludes the guided exercise.
